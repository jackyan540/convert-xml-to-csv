# convert-xml-to-csv
HBS Research Assistant project to convert XML formatted files to CSV formats. Project completed for Professor Jonathan Wallen.

Received data covering Jan. 1, 2017 through Mar. 14, 2022. Data is at the daily frequency level, amounting to 1,900 individual XML files. The objective is to convert these XML files into easier to use CSV files without any data loss.

## Project Specifications

XML file names are formatted as: `WSH_DAILY_SNAPSHOT_ED_V03_YYMMDD.xml` (i.e. for Jan. 1, 2022: `WSH_DAILY_SNAPSHOT_ED_V03_20220101.xml`). CSV file names will have the same format: `WSH_DAILY_SNAPSHOT_ED_V03_YYMMDD.csv`.
